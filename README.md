# Future Proof of Work

Future Proof of Work (fpow) is a new blockchain protocol that reimagines how transactions get included inside a blockchain. This protocol makes the block target time irrelevant to the transaction processing time in blockchains. Using "mini blocks", transactions could theoretically be processed almost immediately without mining an entire new block. This protocol is completely a layer 1 solution.

I am currently programming out this protocol in the rust programming language, and as of now do not have any code to show.

Presentation v1.1 here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VaasNhoAqReZsSF8ieKSFor5x8DWHq1ZIN7V24dyCuA/edit?usp=sharing
v1.1 includes updates to how miner rewards for mini blocks generated are actually included in the state and why.
